<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This Clash of Clans guide will show you how to create a Town Hall 9 farming base that&#8217;s optimized for gaining resources and limiting the loss of your resources while being attacked.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve created a list below that shows you the priority for protecting each resource you have. The priority ranks the resources from most important (left) to least important (right). This guide is optimized to follow the priority list shown below.</p>
<h2>Protection Priority</h2>
<p>Dark Elixir > Gold >= Elixir > Trophies</p>
<h2>Base Layout</h2>
<p><img src="http://game-brain.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/th9-farming-grid.png" alt="Town Hall 9 Farming Base" width="763" height="759" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-319" /></p>
<h2>Base Summary</h2>
<p><strong>Town Hall</strong></p>
<p>This should be placed outside of your base. It&#8217;s better to lose trophies rather than resources when using a farming base.</p>
<p><strong>Clan Castle</strong></p>
<p>This should be placed at the center of your base and is a key structure for defense. Always have units in the castle so that it can be used for offense and defense.</p>
<p><strong>Wizard Tower</strong></p>
<p>These towers do amazing splash damage. Like mortars, they are great against units that are close to one another. You’ll gain an extra wizard tower at this level for a total of four.</p>
<p>This build uses the wizard tower to protect your gold mines and prevent an attacker from sending lots of troops to break the front line of your defense. There&#8217;s a choke point just in front of the wizard tower which causes attacking units to group up in front of it. The build places the wizard tower on the perimeter of your base next to each mine.</p>
<p><strong>Archer Tower</strong></p>
<p>Archer towers are very good at providing single target damage. They’re also able to attack ground and air units which them stronger than the cannon. You&#8217;ll be gaining an additional tower at Town Hall 9 for a total six.</p>
<p>This build uses the archer tower to protect your mortars and cannons from being picked off by air troops. Place all six of the archer towers on the perimeter of your base.</p>
<p><strong>Cannon</strong></p>
<p>The cannon is a great unit for picking off individual troops. It can only target ground troops so it&#8217;s important to make sure that it&#8217;s protected by a tower that&#8217;s able to target air units. You won&#8217;t gain an extra Cannon at this level so you&#8217;ll still have a total of five.</p>
<p>The build uses the Cannon as a front line of defense for picking off units before they&#8217;re able to reach the core of your base. Four of the towers should be placed on the perimeter of your base and one should be placed directly next to the Clan Castle located in the center of your base.</p>
<p><strong>Mortar</strong></p>
<p>The mortar is a very strong defensive tower that deals splash damage. It can only target ground units but it becomes increasingly more powerful as troops get grouped up trying to reach the core of your base. You won&#8217;t gain an extra mortar at this Town Hall level so you&#8217;ll still have four of them.</p>
<p>This build places the mortars on each of the four corners of your base. They&#8217;re being used in this build to prevent an attacker from using lots of units to break down the outside wall of your base. If an attacker is not careful this strategy can give you an advantage on time and destroy lots of their units.</p>
<p><strong>Air Defense</strong></p>
<p>These do tremendous damage to air units and are great for providing protection to areas of your base that are weak to air troops. You’ll gain an extra air defense at this Town Hall level for a total of four.</p>
<p>This build uses the air defense towers to provide coverage to most of your base. Two air defense towers are placed on the perimeter opposite of each other (North and South) and the remaining two are place in the core of your base (West and East). Your base will always have air protection because an attacker cannot easily destroy all four of your towers.</p>
<p><strong>X-Bow</strong></p>
<p>The X-Bow is a versatile tower that is powered by elixir and can be set up to attack all troops within varying ranges. You can set up the X-Bow to attack ground troops from far away or you can set it up to attack all troops at a closer range. The X-Bow has the longest range out of any of the towers if it&#8217;s set up to attack ground targets.</p>
<p>This build places the X-Bow at the center of your base because of its amazing range. It deals great damage and can give coverage to the majority of your base if it&#8217;s set up to attack ground troops. We suggest that you set up the X-Bow to attack ground troops if you&#8217;re in a farming trophy range. Farming armies typically consist of ground troops which is why we recommend using the ground mode setting for the tower.</p>
